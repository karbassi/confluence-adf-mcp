# Project Instructions

## SDLC

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`)
- Keep commits small and focused — one logical change per commit
- Always commit after completing work — use a background subagent for git operations
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) — use a background subagent to update it after commits
- Version using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Track planned work in `TODO.md` — use a background subagent to update it as tasks are completed or added
